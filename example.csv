The difference is Toto never encourages the abuse against those drivers, all Mercedes, Toto, and Lewis do is try to calm the fan base in those events. Horner gets his shit-eating grin going and stokes the flames.

In the case of Schmitz/Tsunoda, he was asked if it should be investigate. He said yes, but specifically for the safety of drivers as Yuki undid his seatbelt, drove a lap, and then AT sent him out with a broken car. That's a pretty reasonable thing to ask to be investigated, and that was specifically in response to someone asking him if there should be an investigation, not randomly putting out comments.

I can't find any comments from Toto relating to Abu Dhabi and Latifi other than him supporting Latifi and calling for the abuse to end.

On Abu Dhabi conspiracy theories, when did he support any? I don't see any mention from Toto that Michael Masi intentionally tried to make Max win.

The Mercedes Benz / Daimler car/automobile division is completely different than the Mercedes Benz AMG Petronas F1 team. MB car division is just a part-owner of the team (not sure about the exact stake, but I believe it was 33% at some point).  Just because the Mercedes car division has so much money doesn't mean they are going to invest all that money into the F1 team.

A few years ago when I checked - The Mercedes F1 team's budget in the earlier years was somewhere around $450 million per year whereas Red Bull F1 team's budget was somewhere around $350 million per year.

Being a smaller team at that point, they depended on a lot of components from other teams and didn't get a chance to focus on the reliability as much. It is a great feat for them to still achieve those four year back to back wins at that stage. But I feel their overall budget has also grown from what it was back then to what it is today.

Even during the Mercedes domination era, RB suffered reliability problems primarily due to their Renault engines. Once they moved to Honda, they were able to slowly get to the levels of the Merc engines and even exceed their performance without sacrificing reliability.

Teams develop and improve their expertise over time and RB is a great example of what a team can achieve in a period of 5 - 15 years.

I know I would've brought smoke bombs, which is actually what they're mostly using, and if caught would've pleaded innocent thay they're not actually flares.

I'm sure the small print prohibits smoke bombs too but they should advertise more thr adverse effect setting them off at a race track had and enforce it. Our club, being a small one, unofficially allocated us an entire stand to play with away from other supporters. Before local laws caught up with us and mandated the club do something about it. Thay was fine, it was observed by adult security with buckets of cold water and first aid training and overall a fun experience with popular support from supporters who watched us from the main stand. They enjoyed our show and it generated a good atmosphere. Telling us flares weren't welcome wasn't going to stop us. I know that would of been our attitude if the club tried to stop us. 

I imagine no possible situation where this is appropriate at an f1 race. Even if you allocated all pyro into a particular section you cannot prevent it reaching some part of an active track. Maybe it could be allowed once all the cars are stationary and in their garages but good luck stopping it before the race unless you somehow confiscated them then returned them all right after the race.

That's the thing though, it may obscure your vision a little bit, but it's not gonna prevent you from seeing the opening lap altogether. People standing up every time the cars pass is a much larger issues at tracks than dissipating smoke particles.

> Plus, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of breathing in smoke

Technically you're not breathing in smoke. Smoke bombs are made using potassium nitrate and sugar, which are both found in food. While not intended to be eaten, they are largely non-toxic. It can be uncomfortable if you're really close to the torch or in an enclosed room, but outside the smoke dissipates very fast and doesn't cause irritation unless you're suffering from something like asthma.

There's still something to be said for making smoke-free stands for those that dislike it, but I don't see why you'd want to ban them entirely. Give people a choice. I know I'd be standing on the smoke stand for sure, and I absolutely despise cigarette smoke for example.",-5,1662117693.0

in40brb,:pierre-gasly: Pierre Gasly,"Pitting right before Yuki's virtual SC was a huge mistake by Ferrari, though. And it cost him the 2nd place and possible fight for 1st.

And to those who think it was just bad luck and no mistake was made, I'll sum up the event :

-Yuki stops claiming something is wrong with tires at the rear (possibly not screwed),  causing a yellow flag.    
-Ferrari prepares to pit Leclerc anticipating a SC. Other teams seem to be prepared to do the same.      
-Ferrari aborts its pit because SC is still not on during Leclerc's possible pit window.     
-AT tells Yuki the tires are ok and that he can go on. Thus he restarts but drives very slowly, indicating that something still remains not right.     
-During this time, AT and Yuki must surely communicate. These communications, although not broadcasted on the TV feed, are available for all teams to listen to, and all teams have a dedicated team in this regard.      
-Ferrari pits Leclerc. [edit: Apparently Leclerc asked if they could not delay the pit a bit, just to be sure there wouldn't be a VSC or SC (surely he must have seen Yuki's car was going very slowly still while passing him and that some further clarification was needed), but Xavi told him he was fine and could pit].    
-Other drivers, especially those competing with Leclerc, have not pitted yet.      
-Yuki pits again for quite long, and goes out again, but very slowly. Confirming that indeed, something is wrong.      
-Turns out there is a huge issue with the rear differential and Yuki is instructed to stop on the side of the track ASAP (around less than a minute after Leclerc's pit stop).     
-Yuki stops and a VSC is declared.     
-Notably every driver competing with Leclerc pits, apart from Hamilton who did not pit at all. This hints that other teams were waiting to see confirmation on whether the race might be influenced by a VSC or SC while Ferrari stopped caring about Yuki's situation at the moment he restarted after initially stopping.

Like Horner, a lot of what he says is calculated with the intention of creating a stir, making a change, etc, and not things that should be taken at face value.  Yeah, I suspect this one was more just Fernando getting hot in the moment than other occasions where he's shit on Lewis, but in general he respects Lewis a lot more than people realize, but saying that is counterproductive to most of his agenda.  However, the same goes for open hostility, if people think he's just hostile to Lewis, that also would be hurt his politicking, so he does need to publicly show he and Lewis are cool.
