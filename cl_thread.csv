iob619d,:Bayern_Munich:,"It was a game of two halves with Barca dominating the first half, they had a very high press (5 players in their final third) and it was very effective but they failed to convert their chances, Bayern on the other hand looked awful with the defense being the only positive and Davies had to carry the ball forward to even have a chance for a build up play in their final third, Muller needs to take more shots instead of looking for an assists, Mane at striker is still not working, Kimmich was out of position a lot which gave Barca an easy pass through the middle. As the second half began, Goretzka came on and brought the ball up the pitch with him and also gave Bayern some Physical presence as earlier they were getting outplayed by Busquets every time a long ball was played.

 A major downside as to why you don't see teams running a high press with 5 men all the time is evident to what happened here, half of the Barca team got gassed out and had next to no press on their final third like they had in the first half as it was physically impossible for them to keep that up, Bayern took advantage of it and were able to build up from the back like they usually do with Kimmich slotting much deeper during the second half than he did in the first which gave Bayern a numerical advantage during their build up and gave Bayern to open up Barca's midfield with Pedri and Gavi not good at closing the gaps defensively.

 Both Bayern goals came from Barca's bad defending with the first one coming from a corner kick header and the other on from Busquets trying to make up for the Pedri and Gavi's lack of defensive awareness forcing him to be out of position which gave Sane an easy run from the middle.

 Barca's wingers although very skilled had very low defensive work rate unlike Bayern's attacking trio which made Lewandowski drop deep down the middle to initiate build up or even when they needed to overload the midfield to open up spaces. Overall Bayern still have some homework to do as they are yet to make sense of their new attacking system but it was a well deserved win and a nice birthday present for Muller.",17,1663103500.0

I still don't understand our squad planning and selection though, why start Alonso over Balde when the latter had been performing very well, If i were him the coach dropping me in the important games would hurt more than a loss against Bayern. I also don't understand why we spend 120m on Raph and Kounde before sorting out our RB spot, that should've been the priority then we get one of our 60m signings ( Kounde imo), missing out on Mazraoui was extremely impactful. Raph and dembele also just don't work together, whoever is the one playing on the right is completely out of the game and this isn't the first time it's happened, just play Fati at LW and pick one of Dembele/Raph.

I fail to understand why he is okay being second fiddle to 34 year old Busquets and teenagers Gavi and Pedri (who are crazy talented for their age) is weird to me. I can understand the appeal to play for Barcelona is huge for any player. 

He had a great opportunity to go and become the main man for although poor Man United team but instead is content on being on the bench. Sometimes I don’t understand the reasoning behind this. 

Barcelona are a gigantic football club, there is no denying that. But if you are a part of that team, you want to play regularly, start games. If you are one of the main players for your national team, then you have to look for most minutes.

Better than trying to sign big name players that will fail or not help in rebuilding.

And maybe get a staff team like at Ajax, with Van der Sar, Overmars and Ten Hag. To really focus on the rebuilding.
