 Here we go trying to prove what I said.
 
 A transatlantic flight releases about 1.8 tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere. 5859 Km or 3662 miles. That is 0.3 kilograms per kilometer or 300g per Km.
 
 There is an average of 9700 planes in the air at any give time as of December 2020.
 
 9700 planes releasing 2910 kilograms of carbon into the atmosphere at any given time (per kilometer).
 
 Most planes fly at around 740-930 km/h , we'll average that for 835 km/h, which result that every hour, planes release into the atmosphere 2,429,850 kilograms of carbon.
 
 21,285,486,000 kilograms of carbon per year. 21,285,486 Tonnes.
 
 In 2020 there was a 6.4 decrease in global carbon emissions for a grand total of 2.3 billion tonnes, which is 2,300,000,000 
 
 21,285,486 tonnes is like ... 1% of total emissions. What the fuck. BRB buying a bycicle and plating trees.

 I am sure the team has talked to Checo after the Spanish GP and reminded him very clearly that he is the number two driver and race wins for him are really only on the table when max is not in second. I guess if max is in second and he is defending hard against a Ferrari and Checo has a gap they would let Checo win in that instance too.

They have probably the best driver in the sport in Kevin Harvick (and that’s coming from a Chase Elliott fan) who is easily capable of rattling off 8-9 wins in a season, which in NASCAR is ridiculous. They have a promising young driver in Chase Briscoe. A guy who showed a ton in the developmental series, but hasn’t done a whole lot in cup, and a 4th seat which is up in the air, but will probably wind up going to Hailie Deegan eventually (still tough to judge her.

 Ron Denis achieved something special in 2007 with that one. It's not often a team implodes harder than Ferrari and to have both your drivers lose by a single point is incredible.
 
 The culture of Ferrari is what it is and has never changed where nepotism and politics plays a part in how long you're with that team and how high you climb the ladder. I can give the example, their lead strategists Inaki Rueda has been fumbling strategy since 2014 and we've witnessed a couple of his glorious contributions in this year's title fight at both Monaco and Silverstone. In any other top team he would have been axed long ago but at Ferrari this man has recently been promoted.
 
 The only way this team is ever going to win titles again is with massive house clean and hiring based on talent and merit not due to politics or rubbing shoulders with influential people inside the organisation.

 People are so reactionary and the media and politicians use this to their benefit. 
 
 A vegan is spotted eating fish (perhaps because they felt they might not be getting enough healthy omega fatty acids and wanted to see if an occasional serving of fish might resolve some kind of health issue) and suddenly the whole community turns on them as if they're the worst person that exists.
 
 There's no black and white in this world. There's no absolute good and bad. If you truly don't want to have any negative impact on the world around you, the only way to achieve that is by committing suicide and becoming fishfood or compost. So unless you're that committed to the cause, the best you can do is to try and have a positive impact on those around you and the environment while having the least negative impact.

 The odds for Max to become WC are clearly null. At least we'll have a new champion, but it did not change anything to the show. RB is ridiculously fast as Merc was in 2019/2020.
 
 One thing that could change it all is a complaint over RB engine as we saw it in 2019 with Ferrari.

 Possibilities:
 
 RBR take over the Honda F1 department and become their own manufacturer.
 
 Mercedes does pull out of F1 in 2021 and will be happy to supply any team as long as their engine wins.
 
 Renault will be left as the only option, this will result in Max leaving RBR and as a result RBR will leave F1.
 
 
 This is all down to the FIA since the start of the hybrid era, Mercedes had so much more to start with over the rest. No additional dymo time for new suppliers as Honda. No reason for Honda to stay, it will be very expensive and will take so long to cath up that it just doesn’t make sence for them to stay.

 An article about this topic from The Guardian on 2011:
 
 > The event had been originally scheduled for March but was postponed as clashes intensified between Bahrain's majority Shia population and the Gulf kingdom's security forces, heavily backed by the forces of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states.
 > 
 > Pressure on organisers to not reschedule the motor race had been intense, with a Facebook campaign calling for its cancellation receiving 320,000 signatures. At least a quarter of staff from the Grand Prix's organising committee, Bahrain International Circuit, all of them Shia, were sacked in April after being accused of taking part in anti-government demonstrations.
 >
 > Clashes have continued since martial law was lifted, though not on the same scale as the running battles seen in mid-February and March. Authorities have been pursuing Shia opposition supporters who staged street marches to demand greater freedoms, equal rights and an elected government in the island kingdom. As the violence intensified, the calls for reform became calls for an overthrow of the 200-year-old Sunni dynasty, which demonstrators say actively discriminates against the country's majority Shia population.

 Personally dropping my story:
 
 
 
 
 For the F2 Race i just sat before pitentry. So didn't see anything in direct sight. Warm-up went down, they started and the first lap was done. Going up eau rouge/radillion, then we saw on the screen what world saw. Some seconds of the crash. Everybody who watched the screens gasped. Didn't take long it was red flagged. Safety and medical didn't go back in and went straight to the scene. After all cars went back in the pitlane there were 3 or 4 ambulances heading to the la source and 4 emergency trucks. They were pushing it. So time was critical. Screen stated the race wouldn't go on and the session would end.
 
 
 
 
 No announcements or such, I wanted to go to the media session at the fanzone. Mercedes, McLaren and racing point would come 1815/1830/1845 for a interview. Before that a DJ with bobbleheads. So I would wait that, perhaps they would say more at the time.
 
 
 
 
 From busstop to eaurouge is like 15-20mins walking. Around 1740 there were some walltires heading back to pitlane for repairs(?). Arrived there like 1745. Top of hill was already empty.
 
 
 
 
 1750 arrived at fanzone with DJ still blasting music
 
 
 
 
 1800 black helicopter going (don't know if this was the medical copter
 
 
 
 
 1815, bobbleheads/DJ didn't end (timeline said so)
 
 
 
 
 1825, screen with timeline of events went black, so no media events?
 
 
 
 
 1828 helicopter back(?)
 
 
 
 
 1830 bobbleheads gone finally (should have been a 10min act), but the DJ got the que to just go on without the MC tellings what's happening and why there is no media session.
 
 
 
 
 1840 decided to go home, but before that I could go to a tribune just before eau rouge with view to the F2 paddock. Saw direct some mechanics with hands in the air with despair movements. Perhaps they heard from fia the news. Direct after I saw a police car going up the hill, but it didn't stop at the crash scene, just went on, perhaps unrelated
 
 
 
 
 1900 left the gate, lots op people knew it from WhatsApp or newsapps or friends.
 
 
 
 
 1915 outside bars pumping music
 
 
 
 
 1930 started the car and went home to end this terrible day
 
 
 
 
 2000 heard the confirmation on radio
 
 
 
 
 And again Rest in Peace. Hopefully there will be an investigation and it will be publicised",19,1567287195

 Lewis Hamilton is the F1 driver for the Mercedes-AMG team. The Mercedes team has been absolutely dominant for the past few years, as you can see, he has won all championships since 2014, excluding 2016, which was won by his teammate Nico Rosberg for Mercedes as well.
 
 Today we saw F1 take the Circuit of the Americas, also known as COTA or US GP. Lewis Hamilton only had to finish 8th for him to win the championship, which was only theoretically being contested by his teammate Valteri Bottas. Bottas finished 1st on the GP, with Lewis crossing the line in 2nd place, which gave him his 6th World Driver Championship.
 
 Now, Lewis Hamilton has surpassed Juan Manuel Fangio for the 2nd place of most Championships won, which they previously tied at 5. The only driver to achieve more championships is Michael Schumacher, with 7. But taking into account Mercedes' great dominance in the sport, and the fact that we are not seeing major regulation changes until 2021, many believe Hamilton will be able to at least equal Schumacher's record, if not surpass it soon.
 
 tl;dr: We are seeing a legend of F1 cement himself as the most-achieving racer of all time, and this subreddit probably finds that really cool, at least I know I do :)",84,1572816493

I don't recall exactly where I was sitting but it was either along the kemmel straight or near le combes but out of direct site of the worst of it. I was messing around looking through the race program when I heard the crash. I looked up in time to see a few of the damaged cars go limping by in front of me - wings damaged, flat tires, etc. They turned the replay off on the boards pretty quick and they red flagged the race so I had no idea what was going on. From where I was sitting you could just see the edge of the track where there were a bunch of people working on the scene. I assumed safety barrier damage or something and they were repairing the track before they resumed. 
 
 
 I got curious and found a replay someone posted on here and it made me sick to my stomach - I haven't watched it since. I remember being really anxious that the helicopters hadn't gotten there yet. I just kept repeating over and over again to my friend I was chatting with why aren't they here, why haven't they taken off. It wasn't a good sign. Later on I saw the flat bed trailers go by hauling away the cars and they were just utterly destroyed.
 
 
 I sat on that hill for hours refreshing every motor sports news site, twitter page, etc I could find until the FIA announced that Hubert had succumbed to his injuries and that Correa was critical but stable. I walked the long way back to my campsite and it was super surreal. So many loud drunk people celebrating - I'm guessing most didn't know what had happened if they left the circuit after qualis. I debated whether or not to go to the race the next day at all. It just felt super weird, the atmosphere was all wrong. In the end I did end up going and all the tributes were nice. I felt my stomach drop when Max and Kimi collided on turn 1, but fortunately rest of the race was uneventful. After the race I walked the track to get back out to my campsite. I found a 'RIP Tonio' sticker that had come loose from one of the drivers cars or helmets. It felt wrong leaving it on the track or throwing it out so I stuck it to the outside of my phone charge brick and its still there. It feels weird having it there, but it feels weirder to get rid of it at this point.

 He's barely 24, racing for Horner and Marko, fighting against the team on the most dominant streak in F1 history and the GOAT driver, and has been in the midst of one of the most intense WDC battles in the history of the sport with several intense on-track incidents.
 
 Who in their right mind would expect him to show the maturity and grace of Lewis if we swapped their roles in Abu Dhabi? Lewis has a massive legacy, seven championships, and so much experience to fall back on both in terms of his emotional development and his sense of his legacy and what this race and this year means to it. Max does not have that, by no fault of his own, and no one should expect him to.
 
 I see no reason to think this is any kind of inherent shortcoming of Max as a human. I see no reason to think that he wouldn't be just as dignified in the face of something infuriating like this in a decade's time with several more WDC titles under his belt and many more years of growing up.
 
 I have been very much rooting for Lewis all season, but Max gets criticized too harshly for some of the things he says and does because of the contrast between the way he handles himself with the way Lewis does - and it just isn't a fair comparison. We have no right to hold him to the standard of a seven-time champion twelve years his senior.",9,1639824154

He will probably also never forget moments like the entire piazza Duomo full of tifosi chanting ""please stay"" after 2018.

 A friend sold his Porsche GT2RS a month after taking delivery and Porsche haven’t given him an exclusive allocation since. It’s supposed to be a reward for loyal customers so they get pretty pissed when the owner flips it for a profit to someone the company didn’t think was worthy.

 Let's be honest, 2018 and 2019 were't his best years. He wasn't fast enough to warrant the number 1 driver spot, was error prone too often and was outpaced by Leclerc in his first season with the team.
 
 Had 2020 been a normal season and Vettel proved his speed the outcome probably would have been different. But as things stand at the moment I am not overly surprised with the decision.
 
 And that's just reading it on the surface, it does seems there was some kind of an internal issue as well between Ferrari and Vettel.",31,1589270831
i1527v8,ferrari,"I'd disagree - Schumacher was adored by the Italians and still is as was Vettel and now LeClerc and Sainz for them it's Ferrari first and whoever can get them the glory of winning. I find it strange that they don't really mention Kimi much but still rate Massa. Maybe it was all the years he spent as Schumacher's No2 or him speaking Italian that wins them over.
 
 As for hit pieces on Lewis I find it the other way around almost the entire British media was writing hit pieces on Redbull and Verstappen following on from Abu Dhabi and to this day they still are. The British media has zero class as shown with this question which I'm assuming was the British Media seeing how poor taste it was.
 
 An example is Craig Slater going over to the Red Bull factory immediately after they won the title. While the team were celebrating their win after 8 years of Mercedes dominance Craig decides to ask questions again in poor taste bringing up Lewis/Mercedes during their celebration. They just can't help themselves.
 
 You can also use DTS as far back as season 1 depicting Hamilton as some hero of F1 and Max as this rash impulsive villain of the sport to show just how skewed the bias is in Hamilton's favour again in part by the producers of the show being British.
 
 I say this with my references being the Italian and British media highlighting the differences.

 Not quite, the air density is the same - it hasn't got thinner. The aerodynamic force is decreased on the car behind largely because the local air velocity over it has decreased. The car in front is dragging air behind it (the slip stream or wake) which decreases the relative speed of the car behind to the air it's travelling through. This is same reason F1 cars lose downforce at corners with a downwind. The extreme case would be a car and a downwind gust travelling at the same speed - from the perspective of the car the air around it would be stationary and it would generate no downforce (ignoring underfloor effects from the boundary layer on the road).",25,1638915221

 What made his ""Ice Man"" persona so brilliant was that it was just him, and it never felt mean spirited when he was extremely blunt about things. His final appearance on grill the grid summed him up brilliantly, when he realised he'd not heard the rules correctly and had to keep going until he got one wrong, so just said his name for the year before his own WDC; it was done with a smile but didn't seem like an act from someone trying to be funny, just Kimi being Kimi.
 
 As a Ferrari fan it'll hurt not having a Ferrari WDC on the grid for the first time since 2000 (I believe there's always been one since Michael picked up his first with Ferrari; with his return covering off Kimi's sabbatical). But it'll hurt even more knowing we won't get any more Kimi moments. However, he's not the driver he once was so it's probable the right time to call an end on a pretty amazing career.

gv72qr2,red-bull,"I think you’re spot on about the double standard between drivers. However, I think if Bottas, Vettel, Stroll, etc. had gotten drunk they too would have also been crucified. 
 
 Any driver who has a group of people who actively dislike them would get hate for that. The problem with the internet is that those ‘hate groups’ have a platform to state their opinions and since F1 is so massive those small percentages of people are actually quite a large number of people who can actually influence public opinion.
 
 We see it time and time again: a driver does or says something they regret, their mistakes (whether on track or off it) are then used by their ‘hate group’ as a way to propagate hatred towards that individual. The most recent example is with George Russell this past weekend. However, I first noticed this weird phenomenon with Lance Stroll. When he entered the sport his skill was doubted and he was constantly bashed for being a paid driver and not deserving of a seat in F1. People absolutely hated him for this and many still do. I used to be one of these people. Then he actually started to settle in to F1 and has now showed some decent performance in the Racing Point (2020 was a decent year for him). With DTS you can see that actually he’s a nice bloke who’s just loving life cause he’s driving an F1 car for a living. But to this day, whenever he makes a mistake you will see his ‘hate group’ appear (Instagram and Reddit comments are riddled with these people) and then he gets bashed till people get bored.
 
 Hamilton is also a classic example, whenever he makes an error his ‘hate group’ (which definitely contains some closeted racists) jumps on his case and uses the error to propagate hatred towards him.
 
 It’s incredibly sad how every single move that a driver makes is scrutinised by the public eye and it honestly feels like each driver has their own set of ‘haters’ who are waiting to pounce. The only difference is the relative size of those ‘hate groups’ and that’s why people like Kimi, Lando or Danny could get away with a lot more than a driver like Lewis or Stroll...",10,1618923317

gwh6pzs,red-bull,"Not the Exact Replica helmets you see the pit crew use but you can get the Same Model of Helmet just without the Paint Scheme or Graphics, the Major Manufacturers are Stilo, Bell and Schuberth.
 
 Look at pictures or Re-watch Scenes of the Pit Crew on DTS (Drive to Survive) and see if you can find a shot of the Back of the Helmet as that's where the Manufacturer's logo will be Plastered. 
 
 They also tend to use Motorcycle Helmets (they are cheaper as most Motorcycle helmets top out at around $1000 USD while the Auto Racing helmets start around $800-900 USD for a full face one) 
 
 These are the Ones I know of:
 
 1. McLaren: The Pit Crew at McLaren uses an Blue Open Face Motorcycle from BELL know as the BELL MAG-9 in the US Market and costs about $189 in the US Market. It is not available in the Blue used by the McLaren Pit Crew but if you intend to use it as a Show Piece you could paint it.
 
 2. Alfa Romeo: Now for Alfa Romeo, I have 2 options for you, first you have the Open Face Bright red helmets they used to use, this is the same BELL MAG-9 that McLaren uses just in Red and with the sun peek removed. 
 
 The newer Matte Black helmets they use is the BELL Eliminator which is also another Motorcycle Helmet, this Helmet retails for about $420 (nice).
 
 3. Williams: Williams uses a very odd helmet compared to the others, the Williams F1 Pit Crew uses the Airoh Commander Helmet without the Sun Peek. The Airoh Commander is an Off Road Motorcycle helmet that retails for about $330, this really is Monkey Season.
 
 4. Alpine: Alpine have also gone the Motorcycle route for the Pit Crew helmets but in a different way, choosing to go with full on MX Helmets with Goggles instead of a Regular helmet with a Face Shield. The Helmet they've gone for is the Alpinestars Supertech M8 which retails for about $500.
 
 5. Ferrari: Just like Alfa Romeo, Ferrari too has 2 helmets for it's pit crew, one being the Open Face Variety and the Other Being the Full face variety, I was only able to pin down the Full Face one which is the same as Alfa Romeo aka the BELL Eliminator which again retails for $420 (nice)
 
 
 On a side note:
 
 1. Red Bull and AlphaTauri have the same pit crew helmets, but due to lack of branding and/or the Unusual shape of the Helmet I wasn't able to pin it down.
 
 2. I was not able to find a clear Image of the Mercedes Pit Crew helmet so I wasn't able to track it down.
 
 3. Aston Martin and Haas pit crews use Schuberth Helmets, but I haven't been able to pin down the exact model.
 
 4. The Ferrari Open Face helmet is from BELL but I've never seen that type of Helmet from BELL before, looks like a Frankenstein job to me.",50,1619820819

 2. Today he over exaggerated his struggles and said something like ""This was something We were working for so long like 10th race and It was tough very tough before that"". And all of that because for 10 races after having the best car for straight 8 years he had the third fastest car, like there are other drivers who have much worse luck than that.
 
 3. I remember him In McLaren days he received a penalty by FIA (iirc a monaco grand prix but not quite sure), he was asked why, and he said ""because I am black""
 
 4. The FIA thing with the rings and the jewelry stuff said that he was specifically targeted by the FIA and then felt the need to show up with multiple Jewelry In the press conference. 
 
 It shows to me like he feels the need to be on a constant fight against someone or something.

ge4wr3c,red-bull,"Same here. I know I spend most of the live threads joking and making somewhat light commentary of the race but I love the sport and I grew up with engines roaring in my backyard and motorsport's have always been a massive part of my life. I thought I could handle something like this because we've all seen videos of terrible crashes before and it didn't really hit us same way. It was terrible but it felt like we'd disociated a bit and it didn't have quite the same impact as seeing it happen live in front of your eyes.
 
 For that reason and for who knows what other reasons, it just felt like a dam of emotion breaking when I saw that happen and it hit me just how in love with the sport and the drivers that I was. I've been to Indy and I've been to a few NASCAR races and I've seen some dirt track racing and kart racing and so many others. I've seen a lot of tracks and I've been able to meet a handful drivers I don't think I've had quite the same connection to all of those events and people that I've had to Formula One. I think we see them so often and we're just used to getting so regular updates from them that despite the danger being there, we just never think it's going to happen to any of them because of all the safety features and the stuff that goes into keeping them protected.
 
 In a strange way I think moments like this really remind us that Formula 1 drivers, mechanics, Engineers, commentators, Marshalls, team members, technical staff, track staff, administrators, and all the other people and fans that are part of this community are actually one giant family. We almost lost a member of that family during this race and that's why I think it's hitting us so hard. I don't think a lot of us realized that there was that family like connection in our brains to the sport and the people involved in it. I think that's why so many of us had that sudden and strong emotional reaction to the crash that we did not understand at all until well after it had happened and we had found out that he was doing okay.
 
 I've brought this up with some other friends that aren't exactly as into the sport as I am and they just didn't seem to get the impact of it because after all, ""he's fine he survived get over it it's not that big of a thing"". Unless you're as regularly involved with the community and the sport as some of us are, the connection and power and importance of such moments are lost on normal folks. I kind of wanted to yell at these friends of mine but I realized that they didn't consider the drivers and everyone else as part of their family as I did. It's not their fault, they just don't get it.
 
 I love everyone that's part of this sport. I love all the fans. I love all the drivers because I get to see them do something that's incredibly amazing every week. I love the commentators at Sky even though we tend to continually just laugh at what they do and dissect their commentary every week. It's all one silly goofy dysfunctional yet functional kind of racing family that bounces around the globe every year to race in exotic locations and to be together enjoying and living for something that we all love.

 I'm looking forward to having him comment on the race, and if we see what we have been seeing this weekend, Nico is set to be picked up as a main, permanent fixture.
 
 He can take dick picks whenever really, or whatever he does on YouTube, I stopped tuning in after the episode where he splits a pretzel with his wife and reveals that, shocker ... He enjoys mustard...
 
 But seriously, Nico has brought major insight that nobody has for these hybrid era races. Practice became insanely intruigung with his commentary, and I am more likely to watch the entire practice sessions, and as a result, I'm asking myself what ""splunk"" does...

 &#x200B;
 
 I came to the sport a few years ago though and I just can't come into a sport and start fanboying for whoever's on top. I've got a ton of respect for him but being new to the sport I find myself much more interested in Verstappen, Norris, and Leclerc. I also like Ricciardo because he's funny and a great driver when his car is working, and Perez because he won a race and set a record for the most races before his first win and I have to admire that persistence and commitment to the sport. I don't really have a team right now. Just drivers I like. It's really exciting to see what's happening with McLaren though.",2,1618706197
hld43fl,red-bull,"Im not sure exactly what it was, i actually thought it was the entire top vane, but the wing was technically legal and passed all tests, but it was banned and tests adjusted because it went against the 'spirit' or intention of the rule. To my mind the merc wing flex would fall under the same category.
 
 As an aside, i saw yesterday that merc had received their impounded wing back from the FIA and they say that they can now see that the illegal wing gap was caused by loose screws. So im thinking that this was probably caused by that additional flex putting pressure on the assembly and causing vibrations that unseat the screws. In other words it lends more creedence to the claim that their wing is flexing.
 
 What puzzles me though is how this passes the new FIA tests brought in after the red bull wing ban, so i get the feeling theres some element in all this that I'm misunderstanding.",43,1637395345

 Ferrari was on par, if not quicker, than Mercedes in the early part of the 2017 and 2018 season - Merc were just able to develop their car like crazy. Similar story to 2021 when Red Bull was on par/ahead for the whole season.
 
 They were obviously by far the quickest in 2019 and 2020, but that was also because of their massive development after testing.
 
 I guess the other thing to remember is that, unlike previous years (except 2021), there’s only a week between testing and the race. Whereas in other years like 2017-19, testing was around 3-4 weeks before the first race (and obviously in 2020 it was 5 months before!)",37,1647170359

 Then in the later years the partnership just went into a downwards spiral, becoming very strained. That obviously is bad for performance too. 
 
 Honda has improved a lot since the move to Red Bull. They opened a new factory, hired new key personel, poured in a lot of extra money. Red Bull is also giving them more room I think. Having a 2nd team using the engine helps a lot. It's basically double the data from races.

h0qpdjt,ferrari,and HAM makes BANK ??,3,1622937419
h7xdv2n,ferrari,"I think the hype around Russell is a result of a couple of things.
 
 First, he did really well in a lot of the junior series (first in F4 his first year, then 6th in F3 the next year, 3rd place his second year, first in GP3 his first year, and first in F2 his first year, besting Norris). He's essentially proved he's capable of winning in a bunch of different series.
 
 He got into F1 and has been in the Williams, which hasn't been a great car for the time he's been in F1, and his just scored his first points for Williams in Hungary.
 
 The second part of the hype around him comes from him substituting for Hamilton last year at Sakhir. He qualified P2, just barely behind Bottas, and lead from the opening lap until Mercedes messed up a pit stop, and put Bottas' front tyres on Russell's car, forcing him to pit again. Despite that, he has able to get back up to P2. Then he suffered from a puncture, and had to pit for a third time, dropping him to P14, and he ended the race in P9 with the fastest lap. Bottas finished ahead of him in P8. 
 
 Russell was able to hop in a team, do better than the full time driver in the other car, and could've won the race, barring a botched pit stop and a puncture.
 
 People looked at that race and have saw how somebody who never scored points wasn't too affected by pressure, and had an impressive race. It sort of fueled the idea that Russell could be a world champion (or competing for it) if he had a better car, which is kind of shown based on his ability to drag the Williams into Q2 and even Q3.
 
 Then you also have the helmet swaps Alonso has been doing, and he wrote a message on the helmet he gave to Russell saying that Russell was a future world champion.

 Engines are reaching a convergence, as is expected after such a long time with no significant regulation changes. We’ve seen the effect it has on the grid this year, and how close and good the racing has been. So, actually, from that perspective it probably doesn’t even matter if a team is a customer or a works team, other then that a works team has a better ability to package their PU in a way to best suit their own car.
 
 With the new aero rules from next year, I feel confident in saying that Merc and RBR have the best chances to get them right.

That’s absolutely astounding and just one example. 
 
 As for your university, I expect the US House to pass legislation guaranteeing that students maintain the same level of financial aid and receive at least partial tuition refunds (whether or not that legislation makes it through the Senate and the President is another question). They’ve already proposed legislation to protect people who are taking financial hits, like making evictions illegal during the crisis. The Federal Reserve has already lowered interest rates so that businesses can have easy access to cheap loans and make these sorts of massive refunds with event/program cancellations and not have too much damage to their bottom line (this helps consumers and businesses; consumers get refunds and businesses don’t lose too much money).

 How does that look to white racists who want to hold on to the belief that they are better simply because they are white? It does not look good at all. The one black entry into the sport has come and done better than the vast majority of your 700+ white entries. It opens up a can of worms: If more black people had the opportunity to enter the sport, who knows, the course of F1 success could look vastly different with very diverse ethnicities.
 
 The racial hatred for Hamilton would not be as severe if he was a slow unsuccessful driver because they would just say ""look a black person is struggling here"". The fact he is as successful if not more than the most successful white drivers is the thorn in their side.",211,1618929623

 Happy for Carlos, I really hope this win will ease him, he being back in his 2021 form would be very beneficial later on.
 
 Ferrari on the other hand... This wasn't the right stategy at all yet I feel their choices varied between whether they cut their finger off or ther leg. A double stack was certainly possible based on gaps but sudden double stacks are inherently risky - remember Sakhir 2020? Mercedes and Russell certainly do -, anything going wrong during pitstop would mean losing valueable positions and possibly the lead.
 
 It should have been an 1-3 for Ferrari either without SC or not (Ocon should have stopped at the old pitlane honestly). Without SC, Hamilton's pace on the hards was enough to catch Sainz but he would not have had a chance on Leclerc. With SC, a double stack could have been done but Ferrari deemed it too risky and they lost on it, not to mention Leclerc not gaining enough on Verstappen.

 I've told this story before, but I went to a bloemencorso my first year here - which is where people make big floats out of flowers with beautiful ornate designs. The year I went (2019), there was a float that was just a giant racist caricature of an Asian person - yellow skin, buck teeth, squinting eyes, and a rice picker hat riding a bike to deliver packages. And they had some of the women paint themselves yellow and squint their eyes to pantomime delivering packages as well. The theme of their float was that site where you buy cheap knockoff products - Alibaba or something like that.
 
 But that somehow isn't even the worst part - the worst part is it won first prize. [They still have the pictures](https://bloemencorsowinkel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/IMG_7153-2-1067x1200.jpg) from it up on their instagram to this day as if it's something to celebrate.
 
 Though, to be honest, I've been to quite a few countries in Europe, and they have all been fairly racist. But if you talk about it, they really say ""at least it's not as bad as the US"". I've lived in the US, on all 3 coasts, it's much worse in Europe. At least the US wants to talk about it and fix it.
 
 Edit: Also, I know this isn't the convo, but they are extremely rude to disabled people here. I've never been treated so consistently poorly as I have been here in the Netherlands.

They say all these things despite having no proof of their claims, and treat her like fucking shit because they know they're not being filmed and will get away with it.
 
 Here's some quotes from one of the many articles I found on a quick search on the film, this article: https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/netflix-afflicted-chronic-illness_us_5b98200fe4b0511db3e6d954
 
 [But “Afflicted” doesn’t illuminate the medical community’s long, complex history of acknowledging mysterious illnesses. For example, the first cases of what doctors now believe to be myalgic encephalomyelitis (more commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome) were observed in the 1930s, yet the syndrome wasn’t added to the ninth edition of the International Classification of Diseases until 1988, and its most commonly accepted diagnostic criteria weren’t published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention until six years later.
 
 None of this history made it to Netflix’s docu-series.]
 
 Another quote:
 
 [He also believes producers used “questionable editing” to spark speculation, particularly when they showed footage of a YouTube video he made several years ago. The full video, he said, is several minutes long, but the only portion that’s shown in “Afflicted” is a clip of Hill saying, “I’ve been sleeping a lot.” 
 
 “I can only guess how insignificant, if not illegitimate, that makes my illness sound to someone who doesn’t know better, which, judging from the responses to the show, is a lot of people,” Hill said.] 
 
 Explain how that is ""documentarians did their best to be sympathetic to what they were saying"". 
 
 If my mothers life has taught me one thing, is that 90% ""specialists"" do their job entirely to make money and don't give a flying fuck about helping the patient. Their only thought is ""how can I extort this person as much as possible, and how much illogical and factually-baseless shit can I spew out of my mouth in the process?""
 
 I don't want to hear what you're interpretation of these people are, I know because I see the life my mother lives, and I understand their anger for being portrayed as crazy because that's all they ever hear anyway.

 EDIT; ""I am pretty sure all those people in the documentary refused to even consider they had unaddressed psychological issues"". Fucking hell I just realized how appalling this comment is.

 Hamilton is undoubtedly one of the greatest drivers ever. The fact is the car won him the titles (he wins half as many in RBR or FER) but his talent is what kept him in the seat.

 On handling IMO, AC is good as is iRacing. The AC handling model is maybe incrementally better but it's more about feel. In my experience key thing is that Assetto Corsa simulates ""seat of the pants"" g-force effects through the streering force feedback and iRacing focuses more on realistically simulating what you'd feel through the steering wheel (and doesn't do so that well TBH) so the handling model for AC seems better because it FEELS better and you can actually catch slides etc more easily because you get more information. iRacing can feel less forgiving than real life in a lot of ways because of its FFB model.

 Although if Mercedes is the right fit I do not know, while Michael is partially responsible for building up that team, how Toto manages Bottas right now that is not a healthy environment for a young driver.

There will be so many more"".
 
 Same applies to George, if not Abu Dhabi some day he will be in a top car with many many podiums and wins, even championships.
 
 This was necessary for Checo to prove what a legend he is and that he deserves to be in a top car soon- because this is the peak and the best season of his racing career.

ghw9gze,ferrari,"I grew up watching this man. My love for Ferrari and my pursuit of becoming a car designer has to do with his driving and his existence. The day he went into coma was the day a part of me just died. I’ve never met him, never seen him yet he has always been a driving force behind my life. Im hoping for the best like everyone else but they way they are keeping this entire thing a secret (rightfully so) makes me think of stuff which sends shivers down my spine. If something eventually happens to him and we get to see the day of his death, i know i will not be the same ever again. Crying, sobbing, depression, these are just words in effort to describe a feeling. I cannot begin to describe the gut wrenching shit i get when i think of the worst. I have a Ferrari logo tattooed on my right wrist and while it may sound like a horrible idea to most of you, it’s a reminder of my entire childhood, why i love cars, why i want to design for Ferrari one day and most importantly, a reminder of Schumi. He will be with me forever. And for those who were lucky enough to be born in 90’s or late 80’s you know that he was the embodiment of what every boy wanted to be in future. I owe him everything. His racing made me follow my passion which is the biggest reason why im here and why i am who i am at the moment. Hell, it even saved me from suicide twice. So once again Michael, i owe you everything and i love you like a big brother i never had a chance to meet. I will wait for the day you’ll be able to at least speak and give us a heads up and most importantly, see your son being an absolute carbon copy of you.

 All insults and profanities are intended to be awful, but the extent of awfulness *is* very dependent on culture. Especially since this word in particular is not a racial slur nor has a discriminatory history. Consider that in English words like ""bastard"" or ""mother\*er."" are fairly common street insults, and sometimes even used endearingly. While, taken at face value, asserting that someone has sexual intercourse with their own parent is also *extremely* vulgar. In some places, even the suggestion that your ancestors have been anything but honourable is enough to start a gunfight.
 
 A Dutchman on the other hand would be mostly confused as to why you'd bring up his parents, or might take it literally and become quite cross. Dutch language instead co-opts the names of diseases as curses, so logically the most serious disease makes for the most profane curse. It is still considered extremely rude of course, but mainly because of its status as en expletive rather than the disease in particular.",8,1603719829

ga5u4h3,red-bull,"If you're genuinely up for intelligent debate, I'll shoot.
 
 The issue in my eyes is not that Max will not say sorry, it's that now a bunch of different groups are telling him to say sorry, including a lot of F1 fans. At what point does your insecurity or dismay of the use of a word become my issue? Well, there certainly is a line, I can't just walk up to a mentally challenged person and say something like ""what's up retard"", because that's *clearly* crossing the line. But that is so far from what Max intended by what he said that the stretch is embarrassing.
 
 But when the term is being used in replacement of idiot, stupid, or moron, to someone that is obviously not mentally challenged, it's just a common expression that is not mocking anyone, and is semantically identical to those other three derogatory terms. If DS is mocked by 'retard', then surely it's equally wrong to use idiot, stupid or or moron, because those are representative of less intelligent groups too.
 
 'Retard' is in poor taste because *we know* it's a little more serious than idiot, stupid or moron. We also know it *used to be* used to describe severely disabled people. Was Max right to say it? No.
 
 But is Max obligated to fulfill every single person's wish to respect literally anything they command? No, that's absolutely insane. He has a right to express himself differently than anyone else, whether it's because of his upbringing, or because he's a brash person.
 
 These groups are asking for a fake apology for something that wasn't intentionally public, that's absolutely going to happen again, whether we know it or not, by someone who couldn't care less because he has his own life to live rather than worrying about offending every single person in some extremely minor way.
 
 Max has a right to not apologize, just like you have the right to brand him, however you want, for whatever reason, and it doesn't make either of you assholes, it means you have a difference of opinions.
 
 People - and these groups - need to grow up and stop demanding other people bow to their every expectation, people fuck up, because we're human, and NO ONE is perfect, and EVERYONE says something along the lines of what Max said at some point probably every day. Max is not claiming to be flawless or heavenly, so expecting him to be held to that degree of remorse is crazy.
 
 You can't even imagine how many things you say on a day-to-day basis are offensive to someone, somewhere. Imagine if groups of people told you you had to apologize for every little thing. Eventually, you'd say ""nah, fuck you"".
 
 The emphasis here is that Max did nothing worthy of an apology, I'm sure he'll make sure it doesn't happen again himself, and if it does, it's not that big of a deal.
 
 This is a quintessential over-sensitivity. And this point here is wayyyy too far. If Max gives into this, there's no saying what else is next. People don't realize that they can just mind their own business instead of joining in on the outrage culture.",9,1603716623

 For example, this coming season, rounds 10-17 - coequally referred to as the ""European Season"" of the calendar - the cars are transported by truck and trailer (like NASCAR, IndyCar, etc). The remaining rounds, outside of rounds 1, 2, 4 and 6-8 are all ""fly away,"" meaning the cars are loaded into containers and loaded onto planes (used to be DHL when DHL was a sponsor, not sure if they're still an F1 sponsor) and flown to whatever location the upcoming race is in.
 
 IndyCar, when it was CART (and even the few foreign IRL races at Motegi and elsewhere) did the same thing for those few races the series had where truck and trailer was impractical or impossible (Australia, Motegi, Rio, Rockingham, EuroSpeedway Lausitz).

duhwsf2,ferrari,"No. It certainly seems so unless you pay really close attention to the cars. Each year, teams have to construct a car within the boundaries of the regulations, but they are free to innovate within the rules. This results in the cars looking broadly similar, but with subtle differences that can have a huge performance impact. For example, the Williams team uses Mercedes engines, but they are much slower than Mercedes because their car is simply not as good. There's a wide gap from the front of the field to the back, and even among teams at the front there are often different approaches. Teams may all come up with a similar design in relation to one part of the car, while arriving at completely different conclusions for other parts. 
 
 Some years it makes a bigger impact than others. In 2009 for example, Brawn GP introduced a controversial double diffuser (some aero bits at the rear of the car) which resulted in the Brawn being substantially quicker than everyone else. The design war is one of the most interesting aspects of F1 in my mind. You never know what the teams will come up with or what impact it'll have.

 This too. Banning guns, arming teachers, better security for schools/churches/malls are just bandaids. Explosives are illegal, but that didn't stop the Boston bombers. The Aurora shooter had explosives rigged up in his apartment, IIRC. The Columbine shooters rigged up bombs in the school. Someone demented enough to kill a large group of people, especially school children, will find a way to do it.

 ""How did you think it would end, Lewis? With you on top at Abu Dhabi?""

 ""I... I-"" struggled Hamilton.

 Slowly the Finn pulled back the blinders. Even in the moonlight of their shared hospital room he could see the bruises, the bandaged-wrapped body, and the cast-covered limbs. But more than that he saw the light turn blue on a young boy he loved from afar for so long.
 
 Now they were closer than ever just two days removed from the worst ""accident"" in Formula 1 history, that claimed the lives of seven different drivers and left these two temporarily paralyzed. It would take months to learn to feel again.
 
 But it would begin on this night.
 
 Extending a hand that might as well have been an olive branch, Valtteri gripped Lewis' arm and felt his warmth flow through his fingertips.
 
 Lewis slowly mustered the energy to roll onto his side. The two teammates looked each other in the eyes for moments at a time before, but now they held on like a blink might end their lives.
 
 Without another moment of hesitation, Bottas, the luckier of the two, pulled himself out of his bed and into Hamilton's with his one functioning arm.

 A lot of people call him a hypocrite for advocating environmental friendliness and being in F1. But the point is even if he leaves F1 another guy who isn't going to talk about issues is going to replace him. And then 0 progress, if that's what we all want then we are doomed.

 On that note, I've heard about pretty similar from athletes in other ""rich"" sports like golf and tennis though, as well.

IMO, they need more people to support the race director. Any race director only has two ears and one mind. In this case, they could have had one person thinking through the restart scenarios while one of them is keeping track of the track clean-up.
 
 So the end was a total shitshow, but I feel bad for Masi today anyway. He recommended the T6 incident on the first lap -- the stewards decided no review necessary, so that's on the stewards if you think that was worth reviewing. The VSC should have been uncontroversial (though I don't understand why double-waved yellows didn't come out in that sector before the VSC? maybe the broadcast just didn't show it?), and the call for the SC to begin with. At the end, he was in a no-win situation. If he ends under SC or with the lapped cars in the way, then RB (and their supporters) would argue that they either should have had a lap to race, or that having the lapped cars in the way is not customary. Given the decision he did make, Mercedes feel hard done.

He represents everything I want in the sport: a driver who came from “nothing” (didn’t pay his way into the sport, nor have a relative to ride the coat-tails of,) and earned his way to the top.
 
 His story is the exception these days, (though, truthfully probably always was,) which is truly sad. F1 is a sport of opportunity, not one of merit. We should be more appreciative of the rare driver that breaks those barriers down and excels.
 
 Plus, while I know he’s very guarded with what he says, he does genuinely seem like a nice guy. My favorite interview with his was on David Letterman’s Netflix series. He let his guard down just a little bit and just seems like a truly likable person. His dad was in the audience and you could feel some pretty raw emotion when he introduced him and explained what his dad had done to help him get where he was.
 
 Like I said, I know it can get a bit boring to watch him dominate season after season, but let’s not forget Sir Lewis Hamilton really should be everything we want to see in the sport, and we likely won’t see anyone like him for a very long time.",71,1618915628

h5v9o1i,red-bull,"While being harsh words, stating that Lewis wanted to kill Max is taking it out of context imo. According to the rulebook Lewis was in the wrong, so everything Horner said is technically true, except maybe the dirty driving part. That's up for discussion, but since Lewis stated it was his corner (the rules clearly say it wasn't) you can consider it to be dirty. Especially if your star driver and friend is in the hospital. I've cooled off a bit after sunday, but just after the crash I was pissed as hell. Horner is just a human, same as us. Maybe not the nicest human, but I can fully understand he was fuming after that race.
 
 I don't think Lewis had no intention of making that corner, I think he wanted Verstappen to get out of the way which wasn't going to happen. He should have waited for a better oppurtunity in my opinion, but hey I'm not behind the wheel. Idk what I would do in a situation like that to be honest. The move I could have forgiven.

i4fubcm,ferrari,"No. Here's the thing, Motorsport and being a racing star is an incredibly rare opportunity. It's literally a 1 in a million career and comes with prestige and money and a bunch of other stuff. The expectations are naturally higher. 
 
 Now, the kid says that someone allegedly told him it was an Italian salute or something. That should be investigated, because being misled by an adult isn't a crime. 
 
 But if he knowingly did the Nazi salute? At a time when Russia is already out of favor with the international community? He isn't getting thrown into jail or being put under massive amounts of debt but he did lose his Golden Ticket. He's going to end up racing for some other Russian sponsored company, maybe, or he'll have to go to school and earn money by doing a boring white collar job. His future isn't ruined, it's just not the same high class future that he thought he had. 
 
 When you're aiming for something that incredibly rare, you're not given the opportunity to make mistakes like this. That's just fact. Why would a sponsor associate with ""the Russian who did a Nazi salute""? Why would a team?",24,1649777614

 * For someone driving what seems like the best car ever made in F1, you along with Hamilton seem on a different planet, at least on most tracks, do you see this engineering supremacy as a good thing or you would have preferred more competition from other teams at the cost of a (slightly) less competitive car ?
 * Honestly, would you prefer a slightly slower teammate or do you believe Hamilton pushes you to go 110% (because some of your quali laps and your races are crazy good when you're close to him) ? I think (same for Verstappen teammate) you have the hardest F1 driver job on the grid, You seem to always beat him at the start of the season, but something happens (pressure, bad luck, tyre management ? ) and a small gap is created between you two at the end.
 * Do you think you could outpace a current Ferrari F1 car on your Bicycle ?",3390,1598954916

Also the fact that it was revealed the Haas was an absolute garbage, [as this video explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC5BjKGl9vw&ab_channel=THERACE), means that Haas last year was more on Williams level than on Alfa Romeo's. It also means that both drivers were absolutely battling with the car just to get points. Therefore it shows that both driver were proper quick, despite their crashing habit. On that final note, the reason they were crash prone, especially Grosjean, was because of their speed, not because of incompetence, as you might see from Mazepin's spins. In short, Grosjean might not be the best driver or great, but he was good enough. Also i personally like how friendly he is.",9,1620202403

 But this is also present in other series. Hell we also refer to eras cars like Marlboro McLaren, Vodafone McLaren, Gulf livery, Martini livery. It’s the same thing!

 So Sainz was unlucky in some ways, but there weren't many scenarios, short of pitting with Gasly earlier, where he would have come out in P1.",1,1599465555

Potentially Norris and Russell too, but they would need a car that can show their potential for that to happen. Hamilton is 37 years old, while the other drivers I mentioned are all 23-25 years old. Other than that, F1 is a team sport. The car plays a very big role. As do the strategists etc. Winning a championship takes a good car, a driver that can deal with the pressure, a team that won't blow it with terrible strategy and mistakes and sometimes (depending on the situation) a good teammate that can collect points when the first driver can't.",3,1652005168

 >Car 44 was exiting the pits. Car 33 was on the main straight. At the 50m board before Turn 1, Car 44 was significantly ahead of Car 33. Car 33 braked late and started to move alongside Car 44, although at no point in the sequence does Car 33 get any further forward than just behind the front wheel of Car 44.
 
 >During the hearing the driver of Car 33 asserted that the cause of th incident was the driver of Car 44 opening the steering after Turn 1 and ""squeezing"" him to the apex of turn 2. The driver of Car 44 asserted that the driver of Car 33 attempted to pass very late and should have given up the comer either by backing off sooner, or by turning left behind the kerb.
 
 >The Stewards observed on CCTV footage that the driver of Car 44 was driving an avoiding line, although his position caused Car 33 to go onto the kerb. But further, the Stewards observed that Car 33 was not at all alongside Car 44 until significantly into the entry into Turn 1. In the opinion of the Stewards, this manoeuvre was attempted too late for the driver of Car 33 to have the right to racing room"".
 
 >While Car 44 could have steered further from the kerb to avoid the incident, the Stewards determined that his position was reasonable and therefore find that the driver of Car 33 was predominantly to blame for the incident.

 Mazepin is, compared to the entire grid, indeed a poor driver, but saying he can't drive the car, and bear in mind we're talking about a guy who had to collect 40 super licence points across three years, is stupid. And the fact that shit like this happens to Schumacher, as well as all those guys I mentioned above, shows that it is not an easy job driving those things. If he doesn't aclimatise to the car towards the end of the year, then yeah, he's definitely out of his league here.

Keep in mind, 32 points ahead seems like a big deal, but one slip up, one blown tire, one clutch problem and Hamilton will be back on Verstappen's ass. The season is far from over. It's not like Hamilton is doing extremely bad, he always ends up in the significant range of points and isn't that far behind from a statistical point or view. Him being behind Lando and struggling also shows that maybe in the future there'll be another contender for the title and I love it.
 
 So far, this season is the most exciting from the past years. We're actually racing now, all across the grid. I don't even really care who wins (okay I'm a diehard redbull fan). I just hope the next races will continue in this fashion. Actual races, not lapping like robots with mercedes dar beyond reach. Here's to am awesome F1 future!!!!!

eys1wqj,ferrari,"Good race. Max was very grown up just accepting that shit happens sometimes, no quest for vengeance or perceived slights, he's matured so much from last season but obviously hasn't lost that killer instinct and number one attitude that will see him win a WC some day.
 
 Renault are soul destroying, ruining Ricciardio like that, gutted that there's not many alternatives for him right now.
 
 Albon looks to be the right call. Serious innovating on his overtaking choosing parts of the track you rarely see people trying, never mind succeeding, to overtake. 17th to 5th is some effort for a new kid who's also just replaced someone in a new car mid-season. Outstanding. Looking forward to more of him, though maybe Monza not a circuit for him to hunt a podium. Very interested to see him and Max chase the top 2 teams now. Red Bull looking set for the future. 
 
 
 Norris was awesome and life isn't fair or he'd have finished wonderfully. Really sucks. As did Sainz's car issues too, not a good day for McLaren to lose out like that today through car faults.
 
 
 Giovinazzi really summoned some racing spirit today and doing great in 7th until he fucked it at the end. Isn't good enough I don't think. Hulkenburg to Alfa next season or another kid methinks. Also have to bear in mind he looked good in 7th, but then remember the Alfas were pretty turboed for this weekend and were it not for turn 1, Kimi probably would've shown exactly what it could do thrashing the living hell out of it. A strong weekend for the car, but not great from Gio to see it through. Next week should be good for them too with that straight line speed again.
 
 
 Leclerc drove a great race, Vettel had the wrong strategy going earliest of the 4 in the top, but also made a few unforced errors that hurt his tires too. Ferrari need to get better at managing their tires and understanding when to make the stops to better help themselves I think. Hamilton pit stop any quicker and the race probably ends very differently. Love to see the relentless hunger from Lewis though chasing the Ferrari down though. So very close. Bottas did well too. Still showing the gulf in class between himself and Lewis but did the right thing saving his car for another day. Might pay dividends in future for him doing so.

 In all fairness though, even those who never make it to the top usually still find success in other categories. Like Indycar, Formula E, DTM, etc. all pay enough to make those kinds of sacrifices worth it. Sure, most Formula E drivers don't end up with millions in the bank, but they do make enough to buy their parents a nice home or something. Like if Ocon never got picked up by Toto and Mercedes and only ever made it to Formula E, his parents' investment in him would have probably still paid off, just less so than it did. 
 
 I imagine there are also parents who go 'all in' on a kid who doesn't even make it to Formula E, or the DTM. However, they should probably realize that when their kid isnt winning races in karting, and should pull the plug on their kids racing dream before they've invested too heavily in it.",3,1621468882

 Max has softs, meaning his tyres will last much less than Hamiltons, meaning he has to pit for Hards earlier than him, so by the end of the race Max will have much older tyres than Hamiltons and will struggle to defend or keep a gap. Hamilton could end up overtaking him in the last laps of the race, Tho Max seems to have the straight speed advantage and if F2 is anything to go by the track is still hard to overtake on.
 
 There's a possibility for max to do a two stop strategy, but is very risky. He would have to be sure he can close the gap from Hamilton and overtake him back, and when you're literally tied for points track position is preferred so it is incredibly risky.",2,1639248909

Putin did everything to destroy our opposition. Navalny and his associates are now officially terrorists and extremists. We don't have a leader to resist. Putin can put anyone in jail for wrong views. I don't think you've heard of this story. Three teenagers (two received a suspended sentence, the third 16 year-old boy will stay 6 years in prison) were arrested for desire to build and blow up the FSB building in Minecraft. But in fact, they just supported the oppositionist Azat Miftakhov. 16 year old boy... We all feel ourselves like in prison. And that's why I really hate things such like that.

ianxp2j,red-bull,"I was looking at Checo's stats over his career, and it is clear that the last 3 years have been his best, with 2022 shaping up to be his best ever. 
 
 In 2020 while still with Racing point, he was 4th in the WDC ahead of Ricciardo by 6 points, despite missing 2 early races due to covid, and 2 DNF/Retirements at the end of his season. 
 
 Then the gap exploded in 2021 with a 25.5 point gap between Checo and the rest of the WDC, coming ahead of Sainz, Leclerc, Norris. And this was after one of his most inconsistent seasons. 
 
 Additionally, since 2014 he has not yet fallen below 10th in the WDC, and in last 3 years has placed in the top 5 (including current season standing of 3rd as of 5/31)
 
 Checo has made some of the greatest strides and it only lends credence to the fact that he was being held back by his car/teams in previous seasons. And while it is also true he has made some immense gains on consistency, he is still one of the best at preserving his tires, which is such a strategic boon for RB.

It took me many many replays with a cool head to see that at the end of the day it was just a racing incident. I agree with the 60/40 blame assessment. Not hard to imagine it took him many rewatches and a nights rest to realize he was overreacting.

 The RB Academy is pretty good at finding drivers. Producing Max, Sainz, Kyvat, Seb, Ricciardo, Gasly and even Albon. All but Albon still racing. 
 
 In 2018, RB had a great lineup with Max/Ricciardo. With Ricciardo leaving, RB essentially had to ""fast-track"" Pierre (arguably not ready at the time) and Albon later on.
 
 But RB being a contender and having a generational talent (and having a difficult car to drive in '19/'20), didnt get a 2nd driver good enough to keep up with Max (or even within the same pit window as the Mercs).
 
 With Pierre not being promoted and RB desperate to find a 2nd driver good enough for Max/a run for the WCC, RB finally pulled the trigger and looked outside the program.",86,1624874916

ge2vt4o,ferrari,"> I honestly never understood the hate
 
 Some people just hate anything new introduced to the sport, no matter what it is.
 
 I've looked at the photos from the crash over and over again, and I'm still just absolutely gobsmacked that Romain got out all on his own. It might just be an issue with the angle, or the survival cell has been moved slightly afterwards, [but it almost looks like the top of the halo is being blocked.](https://i.redd.it/p3spidsev6261.png) Did Romain crawl out through the ""side"" of the halo, or was there enough room for him to get through?
 
 This is obviously a freak accident which no one could imagine, and the aeroscreen (or some version of it) should definitely be the next step in the process of improving the safety of the drivers. However, the idea of having the top blocked off in a freak accident like this with an aeroscreen does make for a nightmare situation. Imagine if he had actually been stuck in there, having to wait for help to reach him.
 
 We, everyone involved or watching the sport, and foremost Romain, were incredibly lucky that he could actually walk out of a crash like that. The safety should never be taken for granted in this sport, despite all the hard work that's put into it.
 
 Edit: [Judging by this video](https://twitter.com/F1/status/1333103417347219457?s=19), it does actually look like he's coming out through the top. Still though, just imagine if that rail had blocked him off. It could've taken a real nightmare turn for him to actually be stuck in that inferno, just waiting for help.",91,1606683413

 Top coin package is $199.99 which gives you 82000 coins. So lets turn it around and say thats how we value the coins. 82k is worth $200. So we need 123,006,150,307.52 coins to fund our team. If we want to earn that from *getting* gold, its going to take awhile as you only get 100 coins per gold. So we need 1,230,061,504 gold awards. Which (if my math was right) would cost $1,500,075,003.75 to buy.
 
 Im sure there are more efficient ways to get there. But I'll volunteer to hold the gold awards and fund the team. Go ahead and gift this comment and we'll start our F1 team fund!

 F1 is theatre and celebrities are allowed the privilege of being present on the grid while it’s being prepared for qualifying or the race. 
 
 Why are they there anyway? Why are they **in the** way? It’s because F1 wants them seen for publicity and *theatre* while the celebrities probably see it as self promotion too.

 Otherwise? Get the fuck of the grid if you want nothing to do with the good folks working it and arrogantly ignore them.

 Fernando Alonso argues that the British press is very much in favour of Lewis Hamilton. The two-time world champion explains that the vast majority of all journalists in the paddock are British and that this gives a colored image to the outside world. The Spaniard already saw it happen when Hamilton was his teammate at McLaren and lets us know that the same is going on in the title fight with Max Verstappen.
 
 In the last race before the summer break, Alonso delivered a tremendous performance by holding off Hamilton on fresher rubber and in a much faster car for laps. He did himself and the Alpine team a huge favor. Afterwards, the Spaniard joked in the square with the TV crews that he had also given Verstappen a hand. On Saturday, the 32-time Grand Prix winner had already let it be known that he thinks Verstappen has ""extra disadvantage"" because he is not British and therefore could use some help from others.
 
 ""F1 is a British environment""
 
 When asked again about that remark after the race in conversation with Motorsport.com and others, the statement was, ""I don't know... When things get a bit hot or when the title fight is about to get exciting, this sport does turn out to be a very British environment. Almost all the teams are British, most of your journalists and the TV crews are British too. In this way it can be explained that the preference clearly goes to the guest from your own country, that he can continue to win,"" Alonso clarifies his earlier remark.
 
 The Alpine driver says he has already experienced it personally and now sees it happening to Verstappen. ""I always felt: when I was racing against British drivers, it seemed like I was always [in the press] 'the bad guy'. At least that's how they wanted to portray me. When I saw the moment at Silverstone and also heard the questions Verstappen got afterwards from the British press, I could understand his position very well,"" Alonso concludes.",4751,1628241857

 I'm going to ask you to back a statement like that up. As far as I know we're talking about several hundred volts and tens of amps DC here. You can definitely get severely hurt, or even killed by that.
 
 And I'm not quite sure what you mean by ""through the hands"". Yes, it'll enter through the hands if that's what's touching the car, but it won't be limited to your hands in any way.
 
 >Sounds to me like electrocution would be the less dangerous option anyways
 
 You make it sounds as if he hade to make a choice between being electrocuted and having a burning F1 car run him over. The third, safe, option would be to stay back until he got clearance to touch it. The car itself is the last thing the marshal should try to save in a situation like this.",3,1657545355

 Normally, a crash with damaged cars on or near the track would have resulted in a safety car but due to potential barrier damage and all the debris, that would have been too dangerous.
 
 During a normal safety car, Hamilton would have had to limp back to the pits and do the necessary repairs. Meanwhile, the other cars keep going, albeit at a considerably slower pace. He would have dropped down quite a lot more, probably among the backmarkers.
 
 However, since the race was red-flagged he was allowed to keep the position he had the moment the Red came out, basically saving his race.

ga62nfl,red-bull,"As a Dutch person I can understand why the word can cause offense, I guess what I understand to a lesser extent is the way this is being blown out of proportion.
 
 While swearing and colourful language is almost ""tradition"" in the Netherlands, so is having a thick skin. Which means a dutch person won't be as easily offended and doesn't think it's that big of a deal if someone takes offense. 
 
 This doesn't make Max using a slur okay. It does explain why he would have thought it wasn't that big of a deal, as well as not being completely bothered by people being offended in the first place.
 
 I think we should take into account how this was ment to be an internal message, and while it doesn't excuse the slur, I feel like FOM's decision to broadcast it wasn't the best. Even if it's wrong, a driver should feel free to talk to his own engineer. They're allowed privacy. 
 
 Regardless, I think threads like these are always a mess. It's hard to discuss these topics without it turning into a ""x is racist and anyone supporting him is too"" and even some comments insinuating things about Dutch people in general gaining some traction.

Alpine has a DNF through a suspected engine issue, Alonso lucks out and ends up P6. McLaren have a garbage qualy, race isn't great but still a good points haul. 
 
 But Mercedes...
 Bottas has a dogshit weekend allover and just when you think Hamilton finally got it together, Gasly fucks up his race simply by driving through the pits and even when he gets a second chance, something completely crazy happens and the Mercs end up with zip.

But all the complexity of the aero means that there's a lot of turbulent, 'dirty' air that an F1 car leaves behind it. This air is much thinner (because the car in front has just punched a hole through it) and much more active, so the aerodynamics don't work as well as they would otherwise.
 
 Because the aerodynamics aren't working optimally the car doesn't have as much downforce which means the wheels will much more easily start sliding across the road instead of rolling across it because they're not being pushed into the ground as hard.
 
 Because Bottas was behind another car he was in its dirty air and didn't have as much downforce.

gfqyrix,red-bull,"Sector three really kills it for me. 
 
 Sector one works. It could maybe use some tweaking, but it's basically the end of the front straight, a fast series, a chicane, and a short run to a hairpin. I'd remove the chicane (which is an existing variant layout of the track!) so that a real blast through the fast turns can turn into a dive, but the basis of a decent sector is there. Sector two is just straights. Honestly, it's too much, it turns every pass into DRS, but...fine. It's not the only place with a long straight. Uninspired but functional. 
 
 But then, sector three. Oh, sector three. We have like ten consecutive low to mid speed ninety-ish degree turns with no space between them for anyone to get a run or be willing to compromise a line for an attack. The amount of time you would lose compared to the chance of actually succeeding boils down to you _will_ lose a lot of time no matter what, and it'll only work if you take Leclerc's brake point for T3 Sakhir. So the final third is entirely processional _and_ because it's downforce heavy, spoils any close running left from elsewhere on circuit. It tanks the entire circuit, all on its lonesome.

i4bssny,ferrari,"Several reasons, one of them is safety, you don't wanna give the teams the option to NOT pit if there is a chance that the tire might not make it, because this could lead to dangerous situations of a team taking the gamble of not pitting only for the tire to fail catastrophically towards the end of the race, potentially resulting in accidents and injuries. (there have been examples in the past of teams gambling with the tire life to a point where it became dangerous)
 
 You can usually get away with not pitting under inter or wet conditions because the wear in those tires is usually very low. However there have been examples in the past of teams really pushing inter tires on a drying tract (that never quite made the transition to dry tires) to a point where i think there were legitimate concerns from Pirelli about potential tire failures.
 
 The other reason of course is also to add bit more strategy to the race, by forcing teams to have to use at least two different compounds it can create some interesting dynamics in the strategy that can improve the spectacle.
 
 There is also another ""hidden"" reason for it, it gives the commentators an excuse to mention the manufacturer of the tires, Pirelli, thus giving the tire sponsor of F1 the exposure it seeks from the sport. Without the pitstops and the different tire compounds, there would be very little reason to talk about Pirelli and they wouldn't get the ROI they want from F1.You can kinda see this happening with the fuel suppliers of the teams, it almost never gets mentioned by the commentators, and i guess a lot of fans even forget that the teams do have different suppliers for fuel, and it is an important performance aspect of each engine manufacturer, but there is no reason to mention because we don't have refueling in F1 anymore.",13,1649703075

In my sim experience, I'm not constantly monitoring all the data on the dash all the time, just specific parts of it at specific times - and I'm sure this is true for irl racing.

I'm not directly staring at the gear indicator but sometimes when I'm shifting down multiple gears and one of them doesn't execute (say my rpm is too high), I know I need to down shift once more as I exit the corner cause I can see the giant number in my peripheral vision. I have very little sim experience with open wheelers with battery packs but so far I've noticed I look at it most often when I'm tailing another car and trying to figure out how best to pass, and therefore how best to optimize battery use to help with the pass.

 Obviously it's impossible say Alonso's tyre would have missed Leclerc's head entirely, but the trajectory suggested as much. However, there is a possibility the endplate of Alonso's front wing could have made contact with Leclerc's visor, but there's no way of telling the severity of that. What the halo did do there is remove any possibility of contact, adding an extra layer of safety on top of the existing cockpit design.
 
 > Speaking exclusively to Motorsport.com about the results of the investigation, the FIA’s Safety Director Adam Baker said: “From the available data and video footage, we are confident that the wheel would not have hit Leclerc’s helmet.

gv8np8l,red-bull,"As a motorcycle rider, I can totally understand that concern, however it's more than possible for you to avoid those situations all together by defensive riding and learning proper incident avoidance techniques. Taking a class on it can really help your confidence.
 
 And to me, the positives of riding highly outweigh the risks, just like driving an F1 car. When you get on the bike, you stop thinking about ""oh no what if I crash and die today"" because you're focused on getting to where you need to go and having fun. It's about your mindset going into it, if you're constantly afraid of crashing, you're gonna crash more. If you're confident and assertive in your defensive riding, you'll have far less incidents than someone who isn't. Obviously it goes without saying that doing stupid stuff like speeding excessively and doing wheelies on an interstate isn't gonna help.
 
 I'm not trying to make you change your mind and hope you get a motorcycle because of my comment, I just want you to know that they're not instant death machines.

 Well that show ended two weeks ago so they can't produce anything anymore now can they? Clearly they had to move on to something else and with the amount of car love in that show clearly it was Formula 1. That said.....
 
 Clarke's Third Law: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
 
 To some folks, the fact that he did survive looked like magic because they don't understand the technology behind it. I know I was using the word ""miracle"" when it happened because I was in a state of shock and I got suuuuuper emotional. So the left side of my brain basically got overruled by the right side and wasn't thinking. Now that it's been a day and there are already a bunch of reconstructions of the accident and how he survived it, I know it wasn't a miracle miracle but there still was a degree of luck involved.
 
 It's amazing that so many things came together all at once and worked the way they did because of all of the years upon years upon decades of research that went into getting just so many factors right that he was able to survive it. There's also a few things that had some weird timings or were very coincidental and I think it's those things that some are attributing a degree of magic or luck to. Stuff like the HALO being implemented when it was or the drivers getting new suits this season that could withstand flame for longer. I get that folks want to show appreciation to the engineers, scientists, regulatory bodies and doctors who put work into this buuuut...can't that also coexist with the idea of miracles?
 
 I work in the healthcare field and there's been times where patients just should NOT have lived and yet did. I consider that a miracle. We've seen large scale engineering accidents that shouldn't have had survivors and weird scientific discoveries that seemingly came out of the blue in a EUREKA! moment. Can't those be considered miracles too? I know you're probably being sarcastic and didn't expect someone to take your comment this far....it is me though...I have a bad habit of doing this BUT....miracle doesn't always have to mean magical. It can mean fantastic or unexplainable or almost like magic even though we know it isn't or ""so unlikely of happening that when it did happen it seemed like some sort of higher power made it happen"". My head is pounding and I've taken allergy meds so forgive me if this doesn't make sense at all but I feel like respecting science and a belief in miracles can coexist one together without having to pick sides.",1,1606780584

If he knew how to overtake maybe he could have. 
 
 Obviously Lewis is faster most of the time but I think the huge glaring weakness with bottas is his overtaking. 
 
 I am guessing if he just got to race his own race for 50 laps he would beat Lewis in terms of time 20% of the time. But when you factor in other drivers and reacting to what they are doing and pushing it to the limit for the overtake. So with all those drivers in the mix Bottas rate you beats Lewis.

 Personally I disagree with the idea that picking up a new language or framework is completely different to moving between something like InDesign and Designer.

In terms of pure statistics, Senna was not the greatest ever (or even of his era, necessarily) but his death pushed him to a level beyond that. Of course his personality and off-track activities contributed greatly to his myth, but I feel he'd be thought of closer to Lauda than Schumacher if he hadn't died, if that makes any sense. Going back to the hip hop comparison, it's like how people talk about rappers like Jay Z, Nas, and Snoop Dogg vs Pac & Big. None of this is to downplay his ability, he's absolutely among the greatest ever regardless of his death, but I do think it played a major part in the status he holds.

I really find the midfield more exciting - There are hard fights going on in the middle of the pack all the time, and those places and points can make a very big difference, and be very volatile from race to race. 
 
 
 All week long Wolff and Hamilton kept repeating this line about ""Everyone out there obeys the rules and gets punished when they break them, except for one driver who breaks the rules and is never punished."" Referring of course to the Jeddah incident. 
 
 
 Then in the first lap, HAMILTON is the one who breaks that rule, and he is instantly on the radio asking if he should give the place back. He knew he should give the place back. 
 
 
 I wish the calls had been good from lap one, that the cars were well matched, that no one dropped in a new engine in the last 5 races and started calling it the ""super engine""... I wish it had been two guys in two equal cars with equal skill going head to head without any name calling or accusations. In that case, I wouldn't have cared WHO won.

I have a Scalextric Hamilton McLaren on my desk right now.
 
 And even as I still see McLaren as Ferrari's ""rivals"" these days (2021 definitely helped with that), I would totally put one of those Gulf liveried McLarens on my shelf. It's a good looking car, and I admit, I like Lando and Ric.

hq5tno0,red-bull,"While everything you said is correct, it actually can be deemed as unsafe, and was considered to be such.
 
 Consider what the fan system allows the car to do. It allows it to take corners at much higher speeds than normal, because of the incredible amount of grip. And that’s due to the ground effects system (the big ol fan). But what happens if that suddenly stops working as you’re about to go into a corner or currently in a corner. For the latter situation, the result probably would just be a spin out. But for the former, you could find yourself spinning off the track at very high speeds and slamming into a barrier, because you tried to enter the corner at a certain speed expecting more grip than you would end up having.

Bottas opens his DRS and lines up wheel to wheel with the Mercedes that shimmers like a swordfish and flops on the deck of a 58' Bertram. Lewis has time to look over at his once great right hand man, and gives him a subtle nod. Valtteri waves and smiles before overtaking and braking into the chicane. Two ships passing in the straight.

 I didn’t even know such organizational body existed. 
 
 > Under Formula 1's regulations, Alpine cannot challenge the board's decision, as F1 teams have previously unanimously decided that it is the highest body that can rule on contractual matters.

 I think it's world championships because when I look at the very first number it looks like a ""99"" more than anything else, and it's pretty common to see 4's and 9's that look similar in people's writing, so it could easily be a quickly written ""4"" . The second number really doesn't look like a 9 in any way( also it wouldn't make sense to put 99 before 98 when the rest are in numerical order.) since it's almost open(not sure how to describe) on the top of the left side and completely open at the bottom of the number, meaning it would be a number that has an opening at the bottom left atleast, which cuts it down to very few numbers 3, and 5 being the most obvious. So it could very easily be a 5 that was written quickly. Which would also got with the idea this isn't an original suit signed by him and just a replica

haujzhp,red-bull,"Then they should have postponed the race to Monday. If they're worried about looking like idiots, form a sensible long-term plan. F1 clearly did not learn the real lesson from Australia leading into Coronavirus, because making up a plan on the fly is also called _not having a plan_. You should be able to lay out what will happen for the next day or two very clearly regardless of scenario. ""If the race cannot be run on Sunday at the designated time, we will first delay for X hours, then if still not we will postpone to Monday"", or whatever the plan is, but if they can't clearly tell you that on _Thursday_ then they didn't do their jobs properly.",16,1630270338

i7d4uyp,red-bull,"I see the point you’re making that NASCAR is lacking on the big personalities, and agree, but part of my point is also that big personalities is what got NASCAR to where it is right now. That’s not to say we’re completely devoid of personality or that things aren’t changing. 
 
 You’d think that about Kyle Busch, but then you go to a race and see he’s one of the most well represented drivers in the stands. He has his own merchandise trailer, and the rest of the team (and most teams) share one between all drivers. I myself am a Kyle Busch fan. 
 
 Joey Logano isn’t well liked, for mostly the same reasons that made Dale Earnhardt so polarizing. In his day, people felt Earnhardt was needlessly aggressive sometimes. Everyone respected his ability though. I like Logano too. 
 
 Denny Hamlin is also almost universally hated and has a very strong personality, but undeniably talented. 
 
 Much like with Earnhardt, Gordon, and Jimmie Johnson, once they’re not driving anymore I think the conversation will shift a bit. 
 
 There are plenty of new drivers who are breaking out, and as they attract more media attention their personalities will shine too. Ross Chastain, aggressive and owns up to it. Chase Briscoe, talented and humble. Tyler Reddick, talented and is vocal about his opinions which greatly differ from the fan base. Alex Bowman, always letting his sense of humor shine. Bubba Wallace, always very open about himself. 
 
 Brad Keselowski, Kevin Harvick, Kurt Busch. Among others.

ieqtoss,ferrari,Championship still over. Charles got what he needed with Max only getting a few points and Ferrari still botches it for him.,4,1656883661
g1233ff,ferrari,"Not sure of the veracity of that comment. Only time I've ever heard Bottas told to hold position was in years where Vettel was 2nd in the Championship and Ferrari were a threat and Bottas himself had little to no hope of winning the WDC and so was out of contention, but the Constructors wasn't a sealed deal so Mercedes got involved to help ensure it would be. 
 
 
 Every other time they are free to race. Note the first Silverstone GP where the tires blew out. Yes they misjudged the tire wear with the heat, but Mercedes also let Bottas and Hamilton race all day long, Bottas never stopped pushing Hamilton, and that's what led to the tire degradation reaching critical point when it did. For both Mercs to go bang within a lap of each other when both were miles out in front and prior to the failure, had a gap of about 1second that didn't change too much and included multiple faster lap efforts from both of them, almost trading at points of the race, you can't argue that they favour one over the other.
 
 There are cases where they did it, but only in seasons where there is no WDC contention and back when their competition was a little bit closer to them to warrant some pragmatism. And Lewis has only ever benefitted from those cases because spoiler alert, he's always been the most successful and leading the Championship in such circumstances. If Valtteri had been in the same position with the team, roles reversed, you can bet Mercedes would've given the instruction. But they rarely do because its rare Bottas is ahead of Hamilton.
 
 
 Now maybe they have told Hamilton in the past to hold, but because he's always in the fight for the title, he may ignore or overrule that advice, but that's what winners do. Bottas in the 1st Silverstone race wasn't letting Hamilton have an easy comfortable day at all, to the car's cost but had the team known the issues would get severe, they may have advised differently or asked them not to race, circumstances different who knows he may have won out, but it's that moment where a driver decides either he's good enough and brings that attitude every race, or if he's a team player just to pacify the team and stay in the good books and a solid finish, than push and risk your whole race to beat your teammate. This season has seen more from Valtteri stepping up and raising his standard. I think he's keenly aware that beating Hamilton is a high bar to reach, but to do it, he has to bring it every race both performing in the car through quali and race day, and an attitude where he's gonna give his teammate a hard time and put him through the wringer every week, which means pushing when Hamilton and sensible strategy for the team would dictate they manage the tires and car for stretches of the race. Hamilton brings that and is why he's so successful, Rosberg brought it and is why he won a Championship. Valtteri gotta get merciless and push every opportunity, even if it means costing the team a little that's what Rosberg did and sometimes it did cost the team, but on the days he won, nobody could say boo to a goose because he got the result, meaning it was justified.
 
 
 Tough gig, but all the shit talkers never have a word to say about Schumacher and Ferrari, who always had team orders and probably even inscribed, ""let Michael through"" on Rubens and Felipe's contracts and then again on Kimi when Seb was their number 1 driver. Every strategy is legitimate sure, but the notion Mercedes are like Ferrari in that respect is rubbish, otherwise Hamilton would already have 7 titles going for 8. But they let their drivers race, unless there is no point to letting them race like when Hamilton was a huge number of points ahead for the WDC race, but the Constructors was in peril and not yet secure as well, in that scenario, when they tell Bottas not to race, they're asking/telling because there is no point to incur the risk of them racing and straining the cars harder than they need to be, which leads to potential issues later in the race. 
 
 Rosberg proved his mettle and won once. Bottas has had a tougher time than Rosberg given he has spent less time in the team, less development input and less experience as well, and faces a Hamilton who is several years more experienced and practiced. Basically a much tougher ask, and this is before we get to the question of talent, subjective touchy issue that it is. But this season is the closest he's been yet, and its entirely been bad luck and Hamilton being better and luckier in most of the races so far. Prior to Silverstone, Bottas was leading, just got heavily unlucky but for the conspiracy theorists who think Mercedes somehow want to sabotage him and it was intentional somehow, I have a bridge to sell you...",6,1597109920

 I'm Italian and while I still believe that yes, racism is still an issue to be solved and probably will always be, it is less widespread than you make it. You're taking as a reference the sport experience, as if to say ""even there this happens"", but in any sport the crowd can get toxic even without racism involved, much more easily than in other situations.
 
 Let me repeat, racism at an acceptable level is always no racism at all and it's not the situation in Italy, but we have a lot of respectful, hard working immigrants that in the last 20 or so years have demonstrated their desire to be Italians. And this changed for the better the opinion of a lot of people, and you know this when you see the grandparents and elderly, stubborn by nature of a lifetime of experience, admit to have had their mind changed.",28,1591081054

With casual fans, often neither interested in cars/motoring or the technical/scientific bit, many start to be interested in other stuff surrounding the sport.
 
 So getting all the history about and around F1, then trying to understand the technical stuff. It is A LOT to take in. A good comparison is Top Gear. A show that was loved by carpeople, but also the casual viewer that just wanted a laugh.
 
 So a lot of the newer fans will rather start on a more personal and human level I think, which meshes perfectly with social media. Instagram with all the pictures and videos, Twitter with all the thoughts and meme stuff. So rather than understanding the cars, they go for the people. Personalities, looks, and the fame surrounding.

 Yes, usually they do, depending on how it is told. If, growing up, you've only heard a certain word used as a common insult, you tend not to study its etymology to determine whether or not it has any futher connotations. You just use it as you hear it. Suddenly having a stranger inform you that they are disgusted with you for using that word does not to provoke a positive gut reaction.

iagpn7h,red-bull,"I was kind of thinking that at the Nouvelle chicane, if you took a couple of the trees out at the exit (they might even have enough money to remove and replant them after the race, maybe), you could either do something like a Joker lap requirement for the race, or you could have a DRS alternative.
 
 The idea would be that you widen the exit of the chicane a bit, by taking out a couple of the trees, then you have an official alternative path to the chicane that just goes straight through the chicane. With the widened exit, you could put a blend line in to keep the drivers sorted out.
 
 With the shortcut of the chicane in place, one option would be to allow drivers who would otherwise get DRS (within 1 second of the driver in front) to shortcut the chicane. That would have solved this Hamilton-Alonso bottleneck issue -- Alonso would have definitely lost his place letting Hamilton getting that close.
 
 The other option would be to let drivers officially shortcut the chicane 5 times per race or something. It's almost the opposite of a joker lap, where usually you'd be driving the long way, but 5 times per race they would get to take the short way.
 
 It might be too powerful to do it that way, but it would at least be something moderately reasonable to allow for overtaking. I still think some of the tight corners and elevation changes on the rest of the track are a nice challenge for the drivers, there just has to be some way to let them pass on a reasonable pace differential, so we can really sort the fastest drivers from the slowest.",3,1653854455

Gasly was there only because Ricciardo left, Hartley never really was a benchmark to begin with. With Kyvat against Gasly they can really see if he has what it takes to drive for RB in the first place. 
 
 
 Is it harsh for Gasly? No, I don't think so. Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes want the best of the best in their cars. Gasly had 12 races to show he has the potential and clearly he doesn't. They (Marko and Horner) didn't expect miracles from him, just a steady no. 2 driver. But with the errors he's made and the damage it is doing to their WCC standing this is the only logical solution. Will it be tough for Albon? Yes. But he has the remainder of the season to show what he can do. Having Verstappen as a teammate can have it's upside too, no one expects you to rise to his level. 
 
 
 This was the right call and although they said they would change nothing during the season, what did you expect them to do? Openly say 'yeah if this keeps going he is out' in public. Of course not. I like RB because they operate in a 'if you can't deliver we will find someone else who can' way.

So it seems unlikely that any F1 team would be that motivated to pull drivers from outside the “F1 system” in this climate. Plus, with the success Pato has already had in Indycar (and will have in the near future), it wouldn’t shock me if he pulls an Alex Rossi and realizes, “oh wait - I can be and am successful in Indycar.

Verstappen was already a driver just as good (if not better) than Lewis, but the car's like a fighter jet now and well, let's be honest, Max is one hell of a racing driver. Redbull's strategy game has been next level lately and with a driver like Max (just compare to Perez, who I love, but just isn't used to the car yet) it's clear that Hamilton now realises he has a hard nut to crack with Verstappen being in this form.
 
 &#x200B;
 
 The fact that last race in Styria he had more than a 30s advantage, managed to get a clean pitstop to increase his best lap by more than a second and then finishing with even 10 or 20 seconds still ahead (I don't remember exactly how many seconds) is just amazing. Hamilton is an amazing driver and knows exactly what he has to work on. I believe they'll get back in the running and make for a great season to watch. With two teams finally matching each other, it's going to be epic. It already is to me.
 
 &#x200B;

It was her first ultrasound of that pregnancy documenting a live fetus. Note that at this time it is a human. Has 4 extremities, a brain, a beating heart, a face. She had zero hesitation that she was going to abort. This was the third time in the past two years she had a documented pregnancy via ultrasound showing a formed fetus, and she had no qualms to go through an abortion for a third time. 
 
 Perhaps this case affected me more because I was already a father at that point, but it really stuck with me. It just seemed so irresponsible that she’s willing to sleep around with whomever, get pregnant, then just kill off the baby. It comes down to education and planning to me. Contraception needs to be more widely available, more so than it already is. Obviously mandatory contraception would never fly in this country.

 He isnt, Russell's pace on saturdays is fantastic but his race pace hasnt been anything special so far. Sure you could argue that the Williams is shit in the race but so far him and Latifi have been quite close on race pace in their 1 and a bit seasons together.

 F1 is a weird sport where you can only judge drivers relative to the circumstances around them. In the Merc dominated era, there's no benchmark where a team has been this dominant over such a long period of time where there have been 20+ races every season. That's why the GOAT discussion is so difficult and controversial.

 Thing is, 6 of his 7 championships so far came in a dominant car. Few sports are as inherently unfair as F1. This makes it almost impossible to compare drivers.
 
 Let me put it this way: if you put prime Hamilton in this year's Haas, he's not gonna fight Mercedes, RBR, Ferrari, McLaren. If you put prime LeBron on last season's Cavs, he's taking them to the playoffs and possibly win one or more rounds. If you put Brady on the Buccaneers, well you know what happened.

 As an American fan, I was intrigued when you had a stint with the NASCAR truck series during your sabbatical after the 2009 F1 season. 
 
 1. Given the fluctuation with popularity in American motorsports, would you ever consider giving the Indianapolis 500 a try especially with Ferrari setting up a team in INDYCAR?
 
 2. Your F1 career will span 20 years if you are still with us for 2021. You are the last of the active drivers who were with us during the era of V10 engines. You’ve been close to lots of drivers and team personnel. Do you haveany funny or interesting stories you’d like to share with us in regards to who you’ve been close to during your career?
 
 3. An interesting fact I’ve learned about you is that you were the only driver to come to Formula 1 directly after racing in the Formula Renault series. Do you think your career would have been any different if you raced in F1’s direct feeder series F3000?

h5t3ou1,red-bull,"The racers putting the blame at the feet of Lewis have tampered my own bias. Lewis made an aggressive move at a critical moment. The biggest error is that he went a bit wide, I am guessing he would have held a tighter line if he had the grip. Going a bit wide is not malicious it’s just an uncharacteristic move by Lewis in such a high risk moment.
 
 Typical Lewis would have breaked earlier and given the line up completely and lived to fight another day. But that changes when Lewis is playing from behind. He has no choice but to take high risk high reward plays. He took the risk and the payoff is suppose to be he keeps the line. Het got inadvertently way luckier than that but that was not the objective. 
 
 It’s a mistake we have to accept when the championship is on the line from the behind in the points car. I bet if Lewis was up 30 points before this race he doesn’t make that play and he would kind of be right is both situations. 
 
 Who is to blame? Lewis of course. He took a high risk move that if it doesn’t work out puts others in jeopardy. That has to come with penalty points. We can’t welcome an increase of risk to driver safety for the hell of it we must still put some owness on the driver to properly weigh the stakes. But if they gamble wrong and still stay in the race that is coming with 10 seconds. 
 
 I actually liked the ruling and the points. Maybe a case to be made for 15 points since drivers safety is the topic. But 10 seemed fair and Lewis was so incredibly lucky to come out of that unscathed. There is no way that could have been intentional. A flat tire would have put Lewis at the back with 10 seconds that’s is unrecoverable. But P2 with 10 seconds. The gods blessed Lewis but the ruling was fair. Lewis races his heart out but I think the team should have been more thoughtful and pointing to incredible luck. Yes they capitalized on incredible luck with their skill but but luck was the key and a driver was in hospital .",36,1626734423

 Norris is über talented, consistent on track but he's very sarcastic (and thus misunderstood),..and yes, sometimes he can say some things on F1 or on twitch just like everybody, people are too harsh IMO.
 
 I think DTS needs to evolve, I'm thankful for the serie as it brought A LOT of viewers to F1 and it's really successful both as F1 marketing (majestic move by Liberty) and as a Netflix show, but the drivers aren't really happy, so they should make a show which is a win-win for both viewers and drivers. F1 has enough adrenaline and drama as it is, let's not add more...
 
 PS: I think all drivers watched the heck out of DTS, I don't buy the ""only two episodes"" but that's just me, the thing is in the top 10 of Netflix most viewed shows (netflix has 100M+ subscribers) and you are not curious to see how they portrayed you or F1 ?

 But staying with a 30M salary next to a more efficient Leclerc was hard,
 
 This is not a calm statement if we read between the lines,...we can sense the tension behind the curtains and it was certainly high : reliability, direction of R&D, tensions between Binotto and/or Leclerc, so many more things we will never know.
 
 Now ?
 
 * Verstappen and Hamilton people need to understand that they are LOCKED, in a good team with capable cars, I don't see how a 2019 RB is less efficient than a 2019 SF car, MV contract is respected by RB for 2019 (performance clause etc.) I really would be surprised to see one of them in 2021 with Ferrari. Also Leclerc and MV do not get along on the track and I think he will refuse a seat for MV, even if it's not his choice he does have leverage and a saying in this. Why would Hamilton leave the imperial F1 team of the hybrid era ? salary ? Couldn't be higher than what he has with Mercedes. Image ? Mercedes is not really what we'd call a bad team and they let him do what he wants next to F1.
 * Ricciardo I think has something in his contract that allows him to leave Renault in case of a seat with Ferrari or Mercedes and he has the reputation, the skills, the image to be in a Ferrari, that'd be neat tbh this is my favourite choice.
 * Hulkenberg, tbh he's a good guy but just never really shined, if Ferrari is really looking for a 'cost-effective' number 2, not a potential world champion until Giovinazzi or a Schumacher is ready in a few years that might do it
 * Raikkonen, I love him can't be objective, but he's just not as fast as he used to be, like Hulkenberg, Raikkonen could be an excellent number 2, pushing R&D, supporting Leclerc and bringing points, plus he has a lot of experience with Ferrari, but neither the fans nor the driver would enjoy the Rollercoaster AR -> Ferrari -> AR -> Ferrari, but IF he wants to stay in F1 in 2021 and other negotiations fail he will be there imho.
 * Sainz, that's a coin toss but he adapted quickly with McLaren and I don't see why he'd be worst than a Raikkonen or a Hulkenberg. I like him and I think he'd shine with a SFXXXX car but there's to many unknown here and he's under contract with McLaren.",19,1589272628

ghad702,ferrari,"> In the docu drive to survive season 2 you can hear the team say to Hulkenberg to not pas Ricciardo and keep a 2second distance instead
 
 This is common though, drivers are told all the time to not overtake especially if its going to be a good result and they dont want them to crash, Ricciardo never asked them to not allow him past.
 
 >Ocon had to let him pass several times and most times it was waranted but at least once i felt like they where way too urly with the command to me.
 
 Are you new to F1 and the Netflix doc is your first foot into F1? not gatekeeping but teams asking their driver to let a driver past is also normal and it's almost always because the driver behind is faster or on a different tyre stratergy and it slows them down and ruins their race.
 
 All teams do this, all drivers do this if they're faster too they usually say something along the lines of ""I can go faster"" then the team radio the other driver and ask them to speed up which they know is a sign they are going to get asked to let their teammate ahead.
 
 It's a team sport and drivers will almost always let their teammate past because if they don't it can ruin both of their races and make their team boss annoyed.",7,1609163418

After that they gained some ground on him of course, being on fresher tyres, but Max was always ""virtually"" in the lead. Without safety cars however he would have had to overtake both Mercedes cars near the end of the race, with fresh softs or mediums against them on used hards. Would have been an interesting finish of the race, but he probably would have been able to do it.
 
 After the VSC he was on new hards ahead of the Mercedes on new mediums. The hards weren't working very well on that Red Bull, but he had a comfortable lead and the hard would have degraded less towards the end of the race, so very unlikely the Mercedeses would have been able to challenge him.

gziuoyq,red-bull,"Legally speaking, that is a completely different animal. 
 
 The rule governing fuel flow explicitly says that you can't, at any time, use more than a specific amount of fuel per hour and a fuel flow sensor has been implemented to police the rule. If the rule governing the wing stated that a rear wing can't move more than x degrees or centimeters, then exceeding that would be an infraction. 
 
 However, that's not what the rule says. It simply states that aero can't be movable (except the DRS) within the margin of what is inevitable due to the laws of nature and the load tests establish those boundaries. 
 
 It is clear that the FIA expected those tests to be more efficient but the wings themselves are not illegal per se. Thus, and this is essentially what it's all about, the FIA made the tests harder to pass but needed to give the teams time to develop new wings. Changing the tests overnight could easily be considered a move of bad faith. 
 
 Merc got their panties in a bunch because of the time frame and not because of the wings themselves. Given the nature of the Baku track, that is understandable.",7,1622042447

 Barrichello and Massa were second drivers, not so fast as real champions (Schumacher, Hamilton, Verstappen). They can’t compete with superior drivers at their times. Massa got unlucky, but honestly he didn’t deserve that title in 2008, Hamilton was stronger and it has always been. 
 
 
 Alonso is a team killer, as in McLaren he is the First Lady, he broke the teams, he broke the unity; think that he didn’t share his data with Massa who is a real second driver. He is not a team player, but formula 1 is also about sharing data and helping the team to build a better car. You can’t be like “give me a fast car” without giving your contribution for it. The driver is the first source of informations for engineering. For example Vettel was absolutely superior in this matter compared to Alonso.
 
 
 Vettel screwed himself many times under pressure, he showed that he won with a clear stronger car with zero competitors and he was simply not at the level of Hamilton; Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen would have won with 2018 Ferrari, be honest.
